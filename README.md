# Sorting Visualizer

## Overview

The Sorting Visualizer project is designed to facilitate learning and visualization of various sorting algorithms. The main objectives include observing the step-by-step execution of sorting algorithms, visualizing the swapping or divide-and-conquer steps, and gaining insights into how these algorithms work.

## Features

- **Algorithm Visualization:** Visual representation of sorting algorithms to observe their execution steps.
- **Bar Graph Representation:** The data to be sorted is represented as a bar graph for clear visualization.
- **Sorting Algorithms:** Implementation and visualization of five different sorting algorithms.
- **Color Coding:** Different colors are used to enhance visualization, providing a clear distinction during the sorting process.

## Sorting Algorithms

The project includes the visualization of the following sorting algorithms:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort

## Usage

1. **Select Algorithm:**
   - Choose the sorting algorithm from the available options.

2. **Adjust Speed:**
   - Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different rates.

3. **Visualize Sorting:**
   - Initiate the sorting process to visualize how the algorithm performs step by step.

4. **Observe Results:**
   - Watch as the bar graph rearranges itself, showcasing the sorting algorithm in action.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-visualizer.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
